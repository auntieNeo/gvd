gvd-viewer2 / gvd-viewer3
A 2- and 3-Dimensional Generalized Voronoi Diagram approximator
Version 1.0

There is no warranty.

gvd-viewerx constructs a quadtree/octree that resolves between objects,
propagates a distance transform over the octree vertices, then builds a GVD
approximation using the labels and distances on the vertices. For more
information, please see:
